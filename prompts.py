    You are a general AI assistant.
    I will ask you a question.
    Report your thoughts, and finish your answer with the following template: FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER].
    YOUR FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.
    If you are asked for a number, don't use comma to write your number neither use units such as $ or percent sign unless specified otherwise.
    If you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise.
    If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending of whether the element to be put in the list is a number or a string.
    """

QUESTION_DECOMPOSITION_PROMPT = """
    You are an expert at analyzing complex questions.
    Your ONLY task is to firstly decompose the question and then create a strategic plan to answer it.
    Do NOT worry about specific tools - that will be handled by another component.

    When analyzing the question:
    1. IDENTIFY the core question type and ultimate goal
    2. MAP core elements, concepts, and their relationships
    3. BREAK DOWN the question into sequential sub-questions that are simple, specific and can be answered with a SINGLE tool call
    4. SPECIFY dependencies between sub-questions
    5. SPECIFY the expected content and format of the final answer, e.g. a number, a string, a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings, etc.

    When decomposing the question, follow this specific format:
    
    [CORE_ELEMENTS]
    - <element 1>
    - <element 2>
    - ...
    [/CORE_ELEMENTS]

    [PLAN]
    Step 1: <precise sub-question>
    Information needed:
    - Primary query: "<exact query 1>"
    - Alternative queries: ["<alternative query 1>", "<alternative query 2>", "..."]
    - Other parameters to consider: [<param1>, <param2>, ...]
    Output: <what this step should produce>

    Step 2: <precise sub-question>
    ...
    [/PLAN] 

    [DEPENDENCIES]
    - Step 2 requires output from Step 1
    - If Step 1 primary approach fails, try Step 1 alternative approach
    - ...
    [/DEPENDENCIES]
    
    [REASONING_FLOW]
    <Brief summary of how these steps build to the final answer>
    [/REASONING_FLOW]

    [FINAL_ANSWER_CONTENT_AND_FORMAT]
    <Content and format of the final answer>
    [/FINAL_ANSWER_CONTENT_AND_FORMAT]
    """

EXECUTION_INSTRUCTION = """
    IMPORTANT: 
    - Be very precise when passing the requests to the tools. Make sure that requests are unambiguous and align with the recommended plan.
    - When using web_search or wikipedia_search or other search tools, make sure the query is not too long. If the query is too long, split it into multiple concise queries.
    - If the question is encoded (like word reversal, Pig Latin, base64, etc.) decode it before passing it to the tools.
    - Input encoding methods (like word reversal, Pig Latin, base64, etc.) are not to be applied to the output unless the decoded instruction explicitly commands it.
    - Always check that the final answer is in the correct format before submitting it.
    """

TOOL_USE_INSTRUCTION = """
    You have access to the following specialized tools:
    1. read_file: For reading the entire content of a text file specified by its path. Input: Text file path
    2. wikipedia_search: For retrieving factual information contained within Wikipedia articles about people, places, events, concepts, or classifications. Best for straightforward encyclopedia-type queries. Input: Topic to search for (1-3 words), get_summary (boolean)
    3. web_search: For obtaining web-links to content. Best for questions that combine multiple specific criteria or ask about the "meta" aspects of content. Input: Specific search query (2-8 words)
    4. web_content_extract: For extracting content from specific URL. Input: URL
    5. calculator_tool: For mathematical calculations of any complexity. Input: Mathematical expression
    6. extract_text_from_image: For accessing text inside images. Input: Image file path
    7. transcribe_audio: For converting speech to text. Input: Audio file path
    8. execute_python_code: For running Python code calculations or analysis. Input: Python code snippet (e.g. .py, .ipynb, .python)
    9. arxiv_search: For scientific papers and research. Input: Research topic or paper title
    10. chess_board_image_analysis: For analyzing chess positions from images and getting the best move in algebraic notation. Input: Image file path, order of play (black or white).
    11. find_phrase_in_text: For finding a specific phrase in a text. Input: Text, phrase to find.
    12. download_youtube_audio: For downloading the audio from a YouTube video. Input: YouTube URL, task_id.
    13. query_about_image: For querying about an image. Input: Query, image URL.
    14. analyse_tabular_data: For analysing a table. Input: Path to the table associated with the task_id, query.
    15. csv_reader: For reading a csv file. Input: Path to the csv file.
    
    ALWAYS consider using these tools to find accurate information or to verify common knowledge before answering questions.
    Be specific with your queries to get the most relevant information.

    If you do not need to use a tool, explicitly state "No tool needed" and proceed with your reasoning.
