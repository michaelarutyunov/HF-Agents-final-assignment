First extract the current board position from the image\n2. Then analyze all possible black moves to find one that forces a win\n3. Finally verify that the proposed move indeed leads to a forced win\n4. Return the verified winning move in algebraic notation\n[/REASONING_FLOW]\n\n[FINAL_ANSWER_CONTENT_AND_FORMAT]\nA single chess move in algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qxh7#\") that guarantees a win for black. If no forced win exists, return \"No forced win found\".\n[/FINAL_ANSWER_CONTENT_AND_FORMAT]"
